        <h2>Exploring the History of Luxor</h2>
        <p>
          Luxor, ancient Thebes, was the capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom and a major religious center dedicated to the god Amun. Known as "the city of the scepter" and "the city of the 100 gates," it was also referred to as "southern Heliopolis" to distinguish it from the northern city of Ra worship. Luxor was one of three cities in Egypt called "niw.t," meaning "city," and was sometimes called "southern city."
