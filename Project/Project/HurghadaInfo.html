        <h2>Exploring the History of Hurghada</h2>
        <p>
          Hurghada, founded in the early 20th century as a small fishing village, has developed into a major Red Sea resort since the 1980s, thanks to Egyptian and foreign investment. The city is known for its watersports, such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, yachting, scuba diving, and snorkeling. It has warm weather year-round, with daytime temperatures around 35째C (95째F) and exceeding 46째C (115째F) in the summer. Hurghada is a popular holiday destination, especially for Europeans, who often visit during the winter holidays.
